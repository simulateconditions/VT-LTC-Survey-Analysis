1) Measures to correct the deficiency:

We have updated the Medication Management
Overview that outlines the policies and procedures that
MPC staff will follow regarding medication
administration. This will be shared with residents
and/or responsible parties and ask that everyone sign
the updated overview, indicating their understanding of
our policies, and their willingness to adhere to them.
Additionally, we have updated our policy on Medication!
Refusal, to include more detailed language about how
long unit-dose medications that are opened will be held
if a resident refuses to accept them.

Specific to resident #1, MPC will draft and present a
Negotiated Risk Agreement for Medication
Administration, documenting the need to take
medication as prescribed during medication
administation times and the risks associated with, but
not limited to, failure to do so. The negotiated risk will
also detail the risks possible when the resident exhibits
unsafe behaviors associated with the medication, such
as diversion of medications (cheeking or hiding
Medication and leaving the medication unattended in
apartment or common areas).

Med Administration staff will receive training on
Resident's Right of Refusal in support of prescribed
physicians order.

 
  

2 Measures to ensure deficient practice does not
re-occur:

(a)The facility will update the Policies with specifics for
Medication Administration times and procedures for
“refused” Medications.

(b)The facility will include an Acknowledgement and
Acceptance of the updated Medication Management
Policies and Procedures for all new residents upon
admission, and will require all existing residents to also,
accept the updates and sign the Acknowledgement
form. This will provide indication that residents are
fully aware of their rights and the facility's
responsibilities related to medication administration.

problems taking medications as prescribed and

refuse medications, if [s/he] is going to refuse
something then we are going to get an order to
[discontinue]. [S/he] is to take all of [his/her]
medications as prescribed."; and stated, "Once
the meds are popped they are wasted."

 
     
 

    
 

     
      
   
     
 

Per record review, the agreement Resident #1
was asked to sign states, "If refuses medications
for any med pass that will end that med pass. Will
wait until next medication pass. If there is a
medication [s/he] wants to refuse, will follow |
proper channels in call MD and obtain a
[discontinue] of that medication.[sic]". This
