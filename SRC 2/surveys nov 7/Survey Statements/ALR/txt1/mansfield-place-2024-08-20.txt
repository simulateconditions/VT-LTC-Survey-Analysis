An Unwitnessed Fall Incident Report states upon
entering Resident #1's apartment at 6:17 AM the
Staff member found the resident lying face down
across his/her bed. Per the Unwitnessed Fall
Incident Report, when the Nurse on duty
responded to the Staff member's call for
assistance Resident #1 was "blue in color,
unresponsive and making loud snoring sounds",
and had signs of an injury on the left side of
his/her head. Per record review Resident #1 was
transported via ambulance to the Emergency
Department, with findings of an intracranial
hemorrhage on the right side of his/her head, and
extensive left scalp edema (swelling) following
assessment. Resident #1 was transferred to a
respite facility for end-of-life care and passed
away on 5/24/24. While the hospital discharge
summary indicates Resident #1 presented to the
Emergency Department after a traumatic fall, it is
important to note the timing of onset and cause of
Resident #1's right sided hemorrhage and
swelling on the left side of his/her head were not
identified.

by the Staff member as completed at 5:14 AM on

checks were not completed between 2:34 AM

The facility's Abuse and Neglect Policies and
Procedures Manual Sign -off states, "Every
resident will be treated with respect and dignity at
all times." The facility has a policy on file which
strictly prohibits employee use of a cell phone in
the facility without permission granted by the
Executive Director.

Per record review, on the morning of 5/17/24
Resident #1 was found lying across his/her bed,
face down with his/her face positioned off the side
of the bed following what was documented as an
unwitnessed fall. Resident #1 was transported to
the hospital with clinical findings following
assessment which indicated an intracranial
hemorrhage on the right side of Resident #1's
head, extensive left scalp edema (swelling), and
a urinary tract infection.

Per internal investigation notes related to this
incident, on 6/14/24 it was reported to the
Director of Health Services (DHS) that the Staff
who found Resident #1 on the morning of 5/17/24
used his/her personal phone to photograph
Resident #1 positioned face down on his/her bed
during this critical medical incident and shared
this photo with another Staff.

An Employee Coaching /Counseling Record
dated 6/18/24 states the Staff was not
“immediately forthright with [his/her] manager (on
both 5/17/24 and 6/14/24) regarding ... improper
use of personal cell phone to photograph a
resident." At 4:14 PM on 8/19/24 the DHS

confirmed the Staff took a picture of Resident #1
lying in the bed and showed it to another staff. On
the afternoon of 8/19/24 the DHS stated the
photo was erased upon discovery and

discovered to have taken the photo was
