approximately 3:30 PM, the entrance to the
kitchenette area, by a half door was open and
unsecured and an unsecured cabinet (within the
kitchenette) was observed to store varying brands
of alcohol.

An interview at 3:35 PM the Memory Care
Director confirmed the storage of alcohol bottles.
S/he confirmed the cabinet is unsecured, and
confirmed the locking mechanism to the half door
as the point of entry to the kitchen was not in
proper operation to secure the door. The Memory

Storage of Hazardous Materials in Reflections".
The ED acknowledges the policy does not
identify, alcohol specifically, however is an item
that is expected to be stored in a secure manner.
