F 812 Continued From page 1

During an observation on 11/25/24 at 2:05 PM,

| there was a baking sheet that was stacked on

' other baking sheets that was noted to be wet.
The baking sheet was placed on the counter by
this surveyor and the steam table pans were
inspected. There was a wet small steam table
pan that had been stacked on others. At this time
the Director of Dietary was shown the small
steam table pan and when this surveyor was
attempting to show her/him the baking sheet it
had been removed from the counter and placed
back on top of the stacked sheets. The Director
of Dietary confirmed that the baking sheet and
the steam table pan that had been cleaned and
stacked for use were still wet. The pans were
found to have been stacked wet and not allowed
to air dry prior to stacking. The Director of Dietary
went into the dish room and returned stating, "I
just educated [dietary staff member] not to do
that, they are not usually back there.”

The floor under one of the food prep table legs
had two squares of missing tile creating exposed
sub flooring with accumulated liquid and food
particles. The leg of the table was noted to have a
buildup of what appeared to be dirt and grease
residue.

The gas stove top was noted to have an excess
amount of food and grease buildup on and under
the burner grates. The Director of Dietary stated
that they are taken apart weekly and cleaned. Per
review of the kitchen cleaning schedule, staff sign
off daily that they have cleaned the stove. This
schedule had already been signed off for

food and grease build up on and under the burner
