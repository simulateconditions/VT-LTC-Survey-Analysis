Deficiency Regulation Code: R190

To: CSP Residential Programs Director

From: Director of Human Resources

ce: CSP Division Director

Subject: POC for background checks deficiencies found re: RCH Licensing Regulations in re-licensing survey for Single Steps

WCMHS Human Resources has been advised that the October 14, 2024 Division of Licensing and Protection’s re-licensing survey of Single Steps
found deficiencies in the employee files of criminal record and adult abuse registry checks. The purpose of this memo is to describe the plan of
correction (POC) to address the deficiencies.

In accordance with section 5.12.b.(4) of the Residential Care Home Licensing Regulations, “(t)he results of the criminal record and adult abuse
registry checks for all staff” must be maintained and on kept on file. Additionally, the agency must conduct background checks, including national
criminal background checks, in accordance with updated guidance published by VT AHS/DAIL on October 24, 2022 and with which compliance
was mandated by May 1, 2023.

WCMHS Human Resources management was provided the updated DAIL guidance by CSP management on October 24, 2022, the purpose of
which was to clarify “what kinds of background checks Facilities are required to undertake to determine whether a prospective or current
employee” is eligible for employment. The guidance included the mandate to conduct national criminal background checks, in addition to VCIC
checks, Vermont Child Protection and Adult Abuse Registry searches, and OIG exclusion searches: however, it has come to light as a result of the
re-licensing survey that the required inclusion of national criminal background checks in the comprehensive background checks process was not
implemented at the time that guidance was initially received.

To the extent WCMHS current background checks processes continue to accord with the requirements that existed prior to the updated guidance
issued by DAIL in October 2022 and do not include national criminal background checks, the WCMHS Human Resources department is actively
working to bring employee background checks systems and processes into compliance with the updated requirements for such, as outlined below:

1. Action to be taken to correct the deficiencies:

a. Implementation of administrative systems and utilization of third-party service provider to conduct all required background checks and
registry searches: The current process and systems utilized do not allow for national criminal background checks to be conducted; as such,
the agency will contract with a third-party service provider to conduct national criminal and Vermont Criminal Information Center
background checks and searches of the U.S. DHHS OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE List) and sex offender registries.
Vermont Child Protection Registry and Vermont Adult Abuse Registry checks will continue to be requested of those entities by WCMHS
HR staff.

b. Conduct background checks and complete files, as needed, for current employees: National criminal background checks will be conducted
for all current employees to fulfill the requirement. Employee files will be audited, and any additional checks needed will be conducted to
ensure that all checks are conducted and on file for current staff.

Measures/systemic changes to ensure continued compliance: Upon implementation of the background checks system as described in 1.a.,
all required background checks will be conducted for new employees at the time of initial hire and periodically thereafter. Files with results of
completed background checks will be maintained by Human Resources.

Ongoing monitoring to maintain compliance: Administrative systems will be implemented to comply with requirements for collection and
maintenance of background check information. Periodic, internal file audits will be performed to ensure compliance.

Additionally, program management will continue to provide notice to Human Resources of changes to background checks and related
requirements, and the Human Resources Director will ensure that appropriate and timely action is taken in response to all such changes.

Dates by which corrective action will be completed:
a. System implementation and checks for new employees: The expected date by which implementation of systems to conduct all required
checks and searches, including national criminal background checks, is December 15, 2024. All required background checks will be

performed upon hire for employees hired on or after implementation of those systems.

b. Background checks and files for current employees: The date by which background checks will be conducted and files will be completed
for staff hired prior to implementation is anticipated to be January 30, 2025.
