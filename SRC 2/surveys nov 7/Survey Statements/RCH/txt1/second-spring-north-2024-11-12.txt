Per record review, the Behavior Plan, Care Plan,

and Treatment Plan on file in Resident #2's

record do not identify the persistent belief

Resident #3 has stolen missing items,

subsequent conflict with Resident #3; and

potential for dangerous behaviors and harm to

others as areas of focus. Specific goals and

interventions to address actual behaviors

demonstrated in response to conflict with
Resident #3 are also not addressed in his/her

| plans of care. While Resident #2's Treatment

Plan states, "[Resident #2] will maintain safe,

| non-violent or aggressive behavior
/communication at all times", specific
interventions are not identified in this plan to
ensure a consistent staff response to aggressive
behaviors and communications. The Treatment
Plan on file was signed by Resident #2 and Staff
on 10/7/24, however updates have not been
made to this plan since 8/3/24. Per Staff Note
dated 11/2/24, a protocol was "set in place” to

| initiate 1:1 support if Resident #2 "started to

| escalate again"; although a written protocol for

staff response to escalation is not documented in

Resident #2's plans of care provided by

| Administrative Staff for review on 11/12/24,

 
 

 
 

 
   
 

 
    
 
     
 

 
   
     
 

 
 
   
 
     
 

 
 

 
 
 
     
 

 
   
 

At 4:07 PM on 11/12/24 the Director of Quality
Improvement and Compliance confirmed the
Behavioral Support Plans, Care Plans, and
Treatment Plans on file and available for review in
Resident #1's and Resident #2's records do not
address specific needs and safety concerns
related to the persistent belief Resident #3 has
stolen missing personal items, and
aggressive/abusive behaviors directed towards
Resident #3.
