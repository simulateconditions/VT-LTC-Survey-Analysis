On 11/4/25 the Division of Licensing and
Protection conducted an unannounced on-site
investigation of one complaint. The following
regulatory deficiencies were identified:

V. RESIDENT CARE AND HOME SERVICES

5.5 General Care

5.5.c Each resident's medication, treatment, and
dietary services shall be consistent with the
physician's orders.

This REQUIREMENT is not met as evidenced
by:

Based on staff interview and record review there
was a failure to provide dietary services
consistent with the Primary Care Provider's
signed orders for one applicable resident
(Resident #1). Findings include:

Per record review, Physician Progress Notes
completed by Resident #1's Primary Care
Provider on 10/21/24 included an order for a
“strict gluten-free diet” for Resident #1 which
states "should avoid all cross contamination -
sharing utensils, cooking surfaces, prep areas
should be avoided in individuals with celiac
disease. Would advocate for education of all
dietary staff/servers surrounding celiac/cross
contamination. Reading all labels to ensure
gluten-free.”

Per observation on the afternoon of 11/4/24 the
home's kitchen did not have a designated
gluten-free food preparation area and designated
gluten free utensils and equipment. The

designated gluten-free storage area was
observed with gluten containing/exposed
products including an open unsealed box of farina
(wheat hot cereal) stored in close proximity to
gluten free products. This storage practice is a
significant risk for cross contamination, which
occurs when gluten-free products are
contaminated by contact with or exposure to
products that are not gluten free. On the
afternoon of 11/4/24, the Kitchen Manager and
Cook confirmed these findings.

The Diet Requisition and Change Order on file for
Resident #1 was checked to indicate Resident #1
has a “Regular Diet". The comment section of
this form indicated "Food Allergies Wheat &
Gluten", however this form was dated as
completed on 2/15/22 and had not been updated
to include additional information related to
prevention of cross contamination included in the
written dietary order received from Resident #1's
Primary Care Provider on 10/21/24. Per record
review, a note dated 10/25/24 written by the
home's Registered Dietician stated Digestive
Services had put in an order to Nursing Staff for a
“strict gluten free diet - should avoid all cross
contamination ...". This note indicated Resident
#1 currently has a rash that "may be related to
allergy" and included the following statements:

a. "Impression: difficult to accommodate
resident's needs and preferences in present
situation."

b. "Explained it is not feasible to have totally
separate area, toaster, etc for special diet in this
level of care (50 other residents to serve as well)
>>> if [s/he] needs more strict than can be
provided, [s/he] may need to look at other
alternatives in terms of placement [sic}"

Per interviews on the afternoon of 11/4/24, three
Staff working in the kitchen and dining areas of
the home stated they had not received specific
trainings related to Resident #1's strict gluten free
dietary needs including prevention of cross
contamination.

At 1:20 PM the Kitchen Manager confirmed
documentation of specific staff training related to
Resident #1's orders for a strict gluten free diet
including prevention of cross contamination was
not on file and available for review.

The home's policies and procedures governing
documents to be maintained on file and available
for review in resident's records indicate resident
records are to include a care plan, however the
policies and procedures do not indicate what
information is to be included in a resident's care
plan.

| Per record review Resident #1 has a

longstanding wheat and gluten allergy and a
recent diagnosis of Celiac Disease. Resident #1's
Primary Care Provider prescribed a strict
gluten-free diet including prevention of cross
contamination of gluten -free products.

The care plan on file for Resident #1 does not
identify care and services required to maintain the
resident's health and well-being related to his/her
diagnosis of Celiac Disease. This finding was
confirmed by the Manager on the afternoon of
11/4/24.

V. RESIDENT CARE AND HOME SERVICES

5.11.b The home must ensure that staff
demonstrate competency in the skills and
techniques they are expected to perform before

This REQUIREMENT is not met as evidenced
by:

Based on staff interview and record review there
was a failure to ensure food service staff are
trained to provide a gluten free diet; and a failure
to ensure food service staff demonstrate
competencies in minimizing the risk of gluten
exposure due to cross contamination for one
resident diagnosed with celiac disease who
requires a strict gluten free diet (Resident #1).
Findings include:

Policies and procedures to ensure staff trainings
and competencies related to resident's specific
dietary needs were not on file and available for
review on 11/4/24.

Per record review, Resident #1 is diagnosed with
Celiac disease and is prescribed a strict gluten
free diet by his/her physician. According to online
dietary resources provided by the Mayo Clinic 's
Gastroenterology department, following a strict
gluten free diet and avoiding cross-contamination
of gluten free products via exposure to products
containing gluten is necessary for individuals
diagnosed with Celiac to reduce symptoms and

minimize exposure to gluten cross-contamination
identified by the Mayo Clinic include using

Per observation on the afternoon of 11/4/24 the
home's kitchen did not have a designated
gluten-free food preparation area or designated
gluten free equipment, and the designated gluten
free storage area was observed with gluten
containing/exposed products including an open

findings.

On the afternoon of 11/4/24 the Cook stated the
kitchen and dining services Staff had received
training related to food preparation and service
procedures required to meet Resident #1's
dietary needs, however 3 dining services Staff
interviewed on the afternoon of 11/4/24 stated
they had not received specific training related to
provision of a strict gluten free diet including
