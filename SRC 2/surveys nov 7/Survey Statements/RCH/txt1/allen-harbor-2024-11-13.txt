In further review post the assessment date of
5/27/24, the record indicated the resident was
admitted to Hospice, the first progress note
acknowledging Hospice care was written on
7/24/24. Through the resident's admission to
Hospice, routine acute care monitoring was
provided, monitoring for safety related to falls and
increased care needs. A “change in condition"
assessment was not completed by the Registered
Nurse to identify the care and services with
hospice and Resident #1 increased support with
activities of daily living.

 
       
   
   
   
      
    
     
 

Per interview on 11/13/24 at 12:00 PM, the
Executive Director (ED) confirmed the resident
assessment on 5/27/24 did not appropriately
assess all the care needs of Resident #1 at the

acknowledged due to the increased care needs
