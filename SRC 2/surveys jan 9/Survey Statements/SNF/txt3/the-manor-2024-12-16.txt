F 000 INITIAL COMMENTS 
The Division of Licensing and Protection 
conducted an unannounced, onsite investigation 
of one facility reported incident (ACTS #23456) 
and one complaint (ACTS #23454) on 
11/12/2024, with additional offsite record review 
that ensued through 12/16/24 to determine 
compliance with 42 CFR Part 483 requirements 
for Long Term Care Facilities. The Administrator 
and Director of Nursing were notified on 11/12/24 
at 3:51 PM of the Immediate Jeopardy 
deficiencies at F600 related to violations around 
abuse and F607 related to developing and 
implementing abuse policies. On 11/14/24, prior 
to the conclusion of the investigation, the facility 
had completed sufficient corrective actions to 
remove the immediate jeopardy for F600 and on 
11/20/24 for F607, but the non-compliance with 
requirements at F600 and F607 remains. The 
survey team identified substandard quality of care 
related to failing to ensure residents remain free 
from abuse and failure to develop and implement 
abuse prevention policies, violations at 483.12(a) 
(1), F600; and 483.12(b), F607. An onsite, 
extended survey was conducted on 11/25/2024 
due to the determination of substandard quality of 
care. The facility is licensed for 72 beds and had 
a census of61 at the time of the survey. The 
following deficiencies were identified: 
F 600 Free from Abuse and Neglect 
SS=J CFR(s): 483.12(a)( 1)

This REQUIREMENT is not met as evidenced
by:
Based on interview and record review, the facility
failed to protect the resident's right to be free from
sexual abuse by staff for 1 of 2 sampled
residents (Resident #1). As a result of the
deficient practice, Resident #1 was transferred to
the hospital and had a sexual assault nurse exam
where genital tearing was detected. Using the
reasonable person concept, Resident #1 would
likely experience severe adverse psychosocial
outcomes related to the event. Findings include:
Per record review, Resident #1 has diagnoses 
that include Alzheimer's disease, major 
depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and failure 
to thrive. Resident #1's care plan reveals that 
s/he has a history of domestic abuse (dated 
1 /5/24) and requires assistance of two staff for 
bed mobility, personal hygiene, and toileting 
(dated 6/9/23). A quarterly Minimum Data Set 
(MOS; a comprehensive assessment used as a 
care-planning tool) dated 10/10/24 reveals that 
Resident #1 has long term and short term 
memory problems and is severely cognitively 
impaired.

in between Resident #1's legs. 
Review of an 11/6/24 written statement from LPN 
#1 explains that on 11/6/24, s/he went to Resident 
#1 's room because s/he had heard a resident 
calling out for help and went to see who it was. 
The statement reads, "On opening the door [of 
Resident #1's room], the nurse saw the LNA, 
[LNA#1], kneeling in the resident's bed between 
[his/her] knees and pumping up and down. 
Resident's knees were being held up and apart 
by [LNA#1]. [LNA#1]'s pants and underwear was 
around [his/her] knees and [s/he] was observed 
pumping in and out." 
Review of an affidavit completed by a Detective 
Sergeant of the local law enforcement agency on 
11/6/24 reveals that LPN #1 verified the above 
statement. 
A "State of Vermont Sexual Assault Examination 
Documentation Tool," completed by the hospital 
during a sexual assault nurse exam on 11/6/24, 
reveals a 1 cm tear to Resident #1 's genitals and 
trace blood on swab. The Examiner's notes 
reveal that while it was difficult to understand 
Resident #1, s/he became agitated during the 
physical exam. Resident #1 was administered 
three antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Doxycycline, and 
Metronidazole) for sexual transmitted infection 
prophylaxis. 
Per interview on 11/12/24 at 1 :25 PM, the Director 
of Nursing confirmed that the facility 
substantiated that LNA #1 sexually assaulted 
Resident #1 on 11/6/24.
