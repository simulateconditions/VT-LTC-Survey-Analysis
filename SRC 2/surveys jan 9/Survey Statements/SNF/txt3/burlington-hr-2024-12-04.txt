Resident #1 stated that a lot of staff don't treat 
him/her like s/he is in his/her own home. Not all 
staff treat him/her with dignity. Foe example, not 
all staff knock on his/her door before coming in 
and a lot of staff give him/her an attitude. There 
are some staff that do all his/her personal care, 
even though s/he is able to wash up parts of 
his/her own body. S/He explained thats/he likes 
to wash the front of him/herself up and they won't 
let her which makes him/her upset because it 
would be faster and s/he would feel better to be 
able to participate in his/her own care. S/He has 
had aides yell at him/her and tell him/her to shut 
up. Sometimes staff won't put his/her call bell 
within reach and s/he ends up having to yell for 
help. S/He stated that s/he should be treated with 
dignity and respect in his/her own house but it 
doesn't feel like his/her home. 
Resident #17 explained that she was told by the 
LNA that they would not help him/her to bed 
because she could do it herself. S/he stated that 
s/he can see some staff pass his/her room when 
s/he has his/her call bell on and don't stop and if 
they do, they say they will be right back but end 
up coming back much later or with an attitude. 
Resident #8 stated that staff often rush his/her 
care. S/he explained that sometimes staff tell 
him/hers/he has to take a shower before dinner 
but that is not his/her preference; s/he would like 
to take a shower after dinner. They don't listen to 
him/her and staff have screamed at him/her for 
taking too long in the shower. 
Resident #19 said that staff never ask him/her 
what they need and don't help him/her at times 
and tell him/her it is because s/he is independent.

A Resident Council meeting with the survey team 
occurred on 12/4/24 at 10:27 AM, and there were 
six attendees, Residents #19, #1, #81, #17, #39, 
and #8. Per record review, Resident #19's has a 
BIMS of 15 (brief interview for mental status; a 
cognitive assessment score indicating cognitive 
intactness) dated 11 /12/24, Resident #1 has a 
BIMS of 14 (indicating cognitive intactness) dated

10/8/24, Resident#39 has a BIMS of 15 dated 
10/24/24, and Resident #8 has a BIMS of 15 
dated 10/4/24. 
A collaborative conversation involving all six 
residents revealed that they do not feel that they 
are treated with dignity and respect by all staff. 
See F550 for more information. They relayed that 
they all know how to file a grievance and the 
process is successful for issues like missing 
personal property. However, when asked if they 
have reported their concerns about not being 
treated with dignity or respect to the facility, all six 
residents explained that they did not feel 
comfortable reporting how they are treated to 
anyone because they are afraid of repercussions. 
Resident #81 reported that if residents report 
rude, disrespectful, or rough behavior from the 
staff, they will get yelled at or ignored. All six 
residents individually confirmed that this was true 
for them and this sentiment was brought up 
multiple times during the conversation.

Based on observation, interview, and record 
review, the facility failed to provide sufficient 
nursing staff with the appropriate competencies 
and skills sets to provide nursing and related 
services to assure resident safety and attain or 
maintain the highest practicable physical, mental,

major depressive disorder.

risk for decreased ability to perform Activities of 
Daily Living [ADLs]" requiring "extensive assist of

Res.#44 on 12/02/24 at 12:01 PM, the resident 
reported s/he is unable to transfer out of bed into 
a wheelchair or onto a bedside commode without 
the assistance of 2 staff members for safety. The 
resident stated that unless s/he is transferred out 
of bed, s/he is unable to attend the group 
activities which are located on a different floor in 
the facility.

Evaluation dated 10/4/24 identifies the resident

order to participate in desired engagement 
opportunities: use of adaptive equipment- electric 
wheelchair for physical limitations". Per interview 
with Res.#44 on 12/02/24 at 12:01 PM, the 
resident stated, "I miss activities because staff 
don't get here to get me out of bed in time. 
Sometimes my lunch doesn't get delivered until 
2:00 o'clock, and Bingo is at 2:00. I have to 
choose: do I go [to activities] or do I eat? 
Sometimes they save me my lunch, other times I 
come back to my room and there is nothing 
there."

with Res.#44 on 12/4/24 at 10:46 AM. Per 
observation, 2 staff were in the room with the

2). Per record review, Res.#145 was admitted to 
the facility with diagnoses that included a fracture 
of the right tibia and fibula [The lower leg is made 
up of two bones: the tibia and fibula. The tibia is 
the larger of the two bones]. Res.#145's Care 
Plan identified the resident as "exhibits or is at 
risk for alterations in comfort related to fracture of 
right tibia, fibula". 
An interview was conducted with Res.#145 and a 
friend visiting the resident on 12/03/24 at 2:25 
PM. 
The resident's friend stated s/he was present on 
12/2/24 at approx. 4:00 PM when the resident 
requested a muscle relaxant medication from 
nursing staff and stated that the resident had not 
received it when the friend left at 5:00 PM. 
An observation and interview were conducted 
with Res.#145 at 5:49 PM on 12/2/24, shortly 
after the friend had left. Res.#145 was observed 
yelling in h/her room stating that s/he had been 
waiting "2 1/2 hours" for the muscle relaxant 
medication. Per interview, the resident stated that 
s/he had yet to receive the medication s/he had 
requested at 4:00 PM. A follow up interview on 
12/3/24 with the resident revealed the resident 
reported s/he received the muscle relaxant 
medication at approximately 6:00 PM on 12/2/24, 
approximately 2 hours after requesting it. 
An interview was conducted with the Unit 
Manager [UM] of Res.#145's unit on 12/03/24 at 
2:35 PM. The UM confirmed a wait time of 
approx. 2 hours for medication to relieve a 
resident's discomfort was "too long". The UM 
stated staffing level "was enough" but could not 
explain why with "enough staffing" a resident 
would have to wait 2 hours for a medication.
