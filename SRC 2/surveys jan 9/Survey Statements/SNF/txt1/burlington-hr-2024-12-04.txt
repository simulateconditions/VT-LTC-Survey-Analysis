Findings include:

Per interview with Resident #88 on 12/3/24 at
approximately 10:05 AM, they stated that when
they ring their call bell for assistance it takes over
an hour most often before someone responds,
and by then they have either wet or soiled
themselves. Resident #88 stated it is very
upsetting when this happens.

Resident #1 stated that a lot of staff don't treat
him/her like s/he is in his/her own home. Not all
staff treat him/her with dignity. Foe example, not
all staff knock on his/her door before coming in
and a lot of staff give him/her an attitude. There
are some staff that do all his/her personal care,
even though s/he is able to wash up parts of
his/her own body. S/He explained that s/he likes
to wash the front of him/herself up and they won't
let her which makes him/her upset because it
would be faster and s/he would feel better to be
able to participate in his/her own care. S/He has
had aides yell at him/her and tell him/her to shut
up. Sometimes staff won't put his/her call bell
within reach and s/he ends up having to yell for
help. S/He stated that s/he should be treated with
dignity and respect in his/her own house but it
doesn't feel like his/her home.

Resident #17 explained that she was told by the
LNA that they would not help him/her to bed
because she could do it herself. S/he stated that
s/he can see some staff pass his/her room when
s/he has his/her call bell on and don't stop and if
they do, they say they will be right back but end
up coming back much later or with an attitude.

Resident #8 stated that staff often rush his/her
care. S/he explained that sometimes staff tell
him/her s/he has to take a shower before dinner
but that is not his/her preference; s/he would like
to take a shower after dinner. They don't listen to
him/her and staff have screamed at him/her for
taking too long in the shower.

Resident #19 said that staff never ask him/her
what they need and don't help him/her at times
and tell him/her it is because s/he is independent.

A Resident Council meeting with the survey team

six attendees, Residents #19, #1, #81, #17, #39,
and #8. Per record review, Resident #19's has a
BIMS of 15 (brief interview for mental status; a
cognitive assessment score indicating cognitive

11/9/24, Resident # 81 has a BIMS of 15 dated
11/13/24, Resident #17 has a BIMS of 15 dated
10/8/24, Resident #39 has a BIMS of 15 dated
10/24/24, and Resident #8 has a BIMS of 15
dated 10/4/24.

A collaborative conversation involving all six
residents revealed that they do not feel that they
are treated with dignity and respect by all staff.
See F550 for more information. They relayed that
they all know how to file a grievance and the
process is successful for issues like missing
personal property. However, when asked if they
have reported their concerns about not being
treated with dignity or respect to the facility, ail six
residents explained that they did not feel
comfortable reporting how they are treated to
anyone because they are afraid of repercussions.
Resident #81 reported that if residents report
tude, disrespectful, or rough behavior from the
staff, they will get yelled at or ignored. All six
residents individually confirmed that this was true
for them and this sentiment was brought up
multiple times during the conversation.

This REQUIREMENT is not met as evidenced
by:

Based on observation, interview, and record
review, the facility failed to provide sufficient
nursing staff with the appropriate competencies
and skills sets to provide nursing and related
services to assure resident safety and attain or
maintain the highest practicable physical, mental,
and psychosocial well-being of each resident, as
determined by resident assessments and
individual plans of care and considering the
number, acuity and diagnoses of the facility's
resident population in accordance with the facility
assessment required at §483.71 regarding 13
residents (Res.#44, #145, #88, #73, #8, #1, #70,
#87, #90, #295, #89, #21 and #6] of 44 sampled
residents.

Findings include:

1). Per record review, Res.#44 was admitted to
the facility with diagnoses that included Right leg
below knee amputation, anxiety disorder, and
major depressive disorder.

Res.#44's Care Plan identifies the resident as "at
tisk for decreased ability to perform Activities of
Daily Living [ADLs]" requiring “extensive assist of
2 with sit to stand for transfers". Per interview with
Res.#44 on 12/02/24 at 12:01 PM, the resident
reported s/he is unable to transfer out of bed into
a wheelchair or onto a bedside commode without
the assistance of 2 staff members for safety. The
resident stated that unless s/he is transferred out
of bed, s/he is unable to attend the group
activities which are located on a different floor in
the facility.

Further review of Res.#44's Care Plan reveals the
resident "states that it is important that he has the

A FWA has been conducted
