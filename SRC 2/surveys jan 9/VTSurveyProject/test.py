Based on interview and record review, the facility
failed to ensure two residents (Resident #73, and
Resident #84] of three sampled residents
remained free from physical abuse. Findings
include:

Per record review of Resident #73's progress
notes, on 4/1/24 at approximately 1:00 PM,
Resident #25 entered Resident #73's room and
struck Resident #73. Resident #73 pushed the
emergency light in his/her room and staff
intervened. Resident #73 had their vital signs
taken and was assessed by nursing staff. Per
record review of Resident #73's progress notes,
the resident sustained scratches on the right side
of his/her neck and right elbow and was "shaken
by the incident."

An interview was conducted on 11/6/24 at 2:07
PM with LNA#1, who was the caregiver during the
incident. LNA #1 stated the emergency light went
off in Resident #73's room. LNA #1 ran down the
hall and found Resident #25 at doorway of
Resident #73's room. S/he was attempting to
push through, and the two residents began
fighting.

Per record review of Resident #25's care plan,
there are no updated interventions after the
incident to discuss how to prevent further physical
altercations with other residents or staff.

An interview was conducted with the DON
[Director of Nursing] on 11/6/24 at 3:59 PM. The
DON [Director of Nursing] substantiated the
incident and confirmed that Resident #73 was not
free from abuse. The DON confirmed that
Resident #25's care plan was not updated with
any additional interventions following the incident

Continued From page 10 pressure injury that is
deep purple or maroon in color, the area of skin
may be intact skin or have a blood?filled blister
due to damage of underlying soft tissue from
pressure and/or shear. There is no evidence that
the facility updated the care plan at that time or
implemented frequent repositioning or offloading
the sacrum. There were also no interventions to
elevate the heels with pillows or heel bolsters to
prevent pressure injury to the Resident #47's

after actual pressure injury occurred on
2/20/2024, until 7/18/2024.

Per nursing assessment "skin check" dated on
7/18/2024, Resident #47 was identified to have a
second DTI to the right heel. Per physician
orders dated 7/18/2024 "Nursing order Pl

Assistant) task documentation record and
Resident #47's care plan reveals that the
intervention to apply heel off-loading device was
not initiated until 7/18/2024 again after the
pressure injury developed. Per care plan the
intervention to tum and reposition was not added

Quetiapine 12.5 mg [by mouth every 12 hours]
prn agitation

May we clarify this order to:

Quetiapine 12.5 mg [by mouth every 12 hours]
prn agitation x 14 days

Please document rationale for continuing this
order.”

The pharmacist's medication regime review
recommends changing the physician order for
PRN Quetiapine to have a duration of 14 days in
March, May, June, and July 2024.

There is no evidence in Resident #71's medical
record that the attending physician reviewed and
acted upon pharmacist's recommendations for
the five months above.

Per interview on 11/06/24 at 1:46 PM, the Clinical
Nurse Coordinator confirmed that there was no
evidence that a physician reviewed and took
action for the pharmacy recommendations made
in February, March, May, June, and July 2024 for
Resident #71.
