required by state regulations or with any
significant change [sic] ..."

1. Per record review Resident #1 is diagnosed
with Vascular Dementia and a history of Cerebral
Vascular Accident, which is an interruption of the
blood flow to the brain often referred to as a
“stroke”; and s/he is prescribed the
anticoagulant medication Eliquis to reduce the
tisk of recurrence. Per review of Resident
Assessments, Resident #1 has impaired short
term memory, and difficulty remembering
requiring direction and reminding 4 or more times
per day. Resident #1 has left sided hemiplegia,
and is dependent on staff for assistance with all
Activities of Daily Living including mobility,
transfers, toileting, grooming, dressing, personal
hygiene, bathing, and incontinence care.

Per interview with the Executive Director
commencing at 12:35 PM on 6/19/24, Resident
#1 has a history of “ideations inconsistent with
what is going on, and reports of delusions about
other residents and associates," The Executive
Director stated the facility is in the process of
discussing possible transition to Memory Care,
and described incidents during which Resident
#1's impaired cognitive function contributed to
altered perception and false or inaccurate
reporting of events. Per the Executive Director, a
recent change was made to ensure Resident #1's
personal care is only performed by female
providers in an effort to provide care in an
environment which Resident #1 perceives as
safe.

does not include care and services related to
Resident #1's individual abilities and needs
related to use of anticoagulant medications;
cognitive impairment and potential risk for altered
perception and false or inaccurate reporting of
experiences; and provision of personal care only
by female staff.

This finding was confirmed by the Executive
Director at 12:57 PM on 6/19/24,

In conclusion this deficient practice is a potential
risk for more than minimal harm to all residents
resulting from unidentified residents needs and
interventions.

maintenance office, and a maintenance staff
personnel will be arriving to retrieve them. The
records were presented at 12:50 PM.

At 12:00 PM the manager on the license of the
ALR arrived to the facility.

The facility policy titled Office Hours /Manager on
Duty (MOD), to summarize the attendance of the
appointed Manager Head on weekends and
holidays to be present in the ALR.

An interview with the Manager at approximately
4:00 PM confirmed the facility poticy for Manager
on Duty practices. The Manager confirmed the
date of survey to be an acknowledged Holiday by
the governing body of the ALR. The Manager
confirmed the Business Office Manager as the
MOD, and confirmed the LPN would not have
access to all the requested items to facilitate a
survey and/or complaint investigation. The
Manager acknowledged the delays that occurred
through the survey process, due to the arrival
time of the MOD and the additional delays due to
limited access to records and requested items
unavailable to the MOD.

The deficient practice is a potential risk for more
than minimal harm as facilities are to have
individuals prepared to carry out the day to day
responsibilities of the Manager, to include
ensuring the needs of residents, maintain a safe
environment and facilitate onsite visits by the
state licensing agency.
